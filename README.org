#+TITLE: A new ASE interface to Vasp
#+date: May 4, 2016

* Why?
To make it compliant with the FileIOCalculator in ase, and hopefully simplify it.

* Goals
1. Provide an interface that allows all vasp keywords without further modification.
2. But also an interface that can be extended to allow validation, and
   user-defined special keywords.
3. Smart restarts. We don't want to run unnecessary calculations if
   they are already done. We want one script that runs calculations
   and does analysis.

* Roadmap
