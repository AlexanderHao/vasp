#+TITLE: A new ASE interface to Vasp
#+date: May 4, 2016

* Why?
To make it compliant with the FileIOCalculator in ase, and hopefully simplify it.

* Goals
1. Provide an interface that allows all vasp INCAR tags without
   further modification, i.e. they are just kwargs to the calculator.
2. Eliminate need for long lists of supported keywords.
2. But also an interface that can be extended to allow validation, and
   user-defined special keywords.
3. Better treatment of the xc keyword to make it easier to use
   different functionals.
4. Smart restarts. We don't want to run unnecessary calculations if
   they are already done. We want one script that runs calculations
   and does analysis.

* Roadmap
  1. vaspsum
  2. NEB
  3. [[./vasp/readers.py]]
    - read_incar
